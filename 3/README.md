## Solving the knapsack problem by DP, B&B, and by APX algorithm

We come back to the classical 0-1 knapsack problem where a subset of **N** items is given and has to be packed in a knapsack of capacity **M**. Each item has two characteristics: weight **W** and cost **C**. The problem is to pack knapsack in such way to reach the most maximum profit.

System of equations is hold:
