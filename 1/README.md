## Solving the knapsack problem by brute force and simple heuristic

### Problem Statement

*The basics*

The **knapsack problem** or **rucksack problem** is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

*Out task*

To solve the knapsack problem by brute force and simple heuristic algorithms. All experiments should be performed on sets of 50 instances of one size. 

All instances are saved in the text files, the files are named knap_n.inst.dat, where n is the instance size. Each row describes one instance. Each instance is identified by (ID), the number of items (n) and the knapsack capacity (M) follow. Next there are listed weights and costs of individual items.
